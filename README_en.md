## Introduction

MemoryBank is a novel memory mechanism designed for Large Language Models (LLMs). With MemoryBank, models can access relevant memories, continuously evolve through memory updates, and adapt to user personalities by synthesizing past interactions. Inspired by the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve theory, MemoryBank incorporates a unique memory updating mechanism that mimics human-like memory behavior. This enables the AI to selectively forget or reinforce memories based on their significance and the passage of time, creating a remarkably natural memory system. MemoryBank seamlessly integrates with both closed-source models like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) and open-source models like [ChatGLM](https://github.com/THUDM/ChatGLM-6B) and [BELLE](https://github.com/LianjiaTech/BELLE).

SilconFriend is a bilingual LLM-based chatbot with MemoryBank Mechanism in a long-term AI Companion scenario. By tuning on psychological dialogs data with LoRA(Low-Rank Adaptation), SiliconFriend displays heightened empathy in its interactions. Experiment involves both qualitative analysis with real-world user dialogs and quantitative analysis with simulated dialogs generated by ChatGPT. The results of our analysis reveal that SiliconFriend, equipped with MemoryBank, exhibits a strong capability for long-term companionship as it can provide emphatic response, recall relevant memories and understand user personality.

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

Install the requirements with pip: `pip install -r requirement.txt`. All experiments are conducted on a single Tesla A100 80GB GPU and cuda 11.7 environment. 

### Download Models 
SiliconFriend offers two [LoRA checkpoints](https://github.com/zhongwanjun/MemoryBank-SiliconFriend/releases/tag/LoRA_checkpoint), which are tuned with 38K chinese psychological dialog data based on ChatGLM and BELLE seperately.
Before downloading models, please ensure that you have installed[Git LFS](https://docs.github.com/zh/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage).
#### Download SiliconFriend(ChatGLM)

Download ChatGLM model at first, and then download the LoRA Model.

```shell
cd model
git clone https://huggingface.co/THUDM/chatglm-6b
git clone https://github.com/zhongwanjun/MemoryBank-SiliconFriend/releases/download/LoRA_checkpoint/ChatGLM-LoRA-checkpoint.zip
unzip ChatGLM-LoRA-checkpoint.zip
rm ChatGLM-LoRA-checkpoint.zip
cd ..
```

#### Download SiliconFriend(BELLE)

Download BELLE model at first, and then download the LoRA Model.

```shell
cd model
git clone https://huggingface.co/BelleGroup/BELLE-LLaMA-7B-2M-enc
git clone https://github.com/zhongwanjun/MemoryBank-SiliconFriend/releases/download/LoRA_checkpoint/BELLE-LoRA-checkpoint.zip
unzip BELLE-LoRA-checkpoint.zip
rm BELLE-LoRA-checkpoint.zip
cd ..
```

### Usage

#### SiliconFriend(ChatGLM) Web Demo

Fill in 'OPENAI_API_KEY' and 'adapter_model' in [SiliconFriend-ChatGLM/launch.sh](SiliconFriend-ChatGLM/launch.sh). When running the bash, use the flag '--language=en' for English language and '--language=cn' for Chinese language. And run [SiliconFriend-ChatGLM/launch.sh](SiliconFriend-ChatGLM/launch.sh) in the repo:

```shell
./SiliconFriend-ChatGLM/launch.sh
```

#### SiliconFriend(ChatGLM) CLI Demo

Fill in 'OPENAI_API_KEY' and 'adapter_model' in [SiliconFriend-ChatGLM/launch_cmd.sh](SiliconFriend-ChatGLM/launch_cmd.sh). When running the bash, use the flag '--language=en' for English language and '--language=cn' for Chinese language. And run [SiliconFriend-ChatGLM/launch_cmd.sh](SiliconFriend-ChatGLM/launch_cmd.sh) in the repo:

```shell
./SiliconFriend-ChatGLM/launch_cmd.sh
```

#### SiliconFriend(ChatGPT) Web Demo

Fill in 'OPENAI_API_KEY' in [SiliconFriend-ChatGPT/launch.sh](SiliconFriend-ChatGPT/launch.sh).When running the bash, use the flag '--language=en' for English language and '--language=cn' for Chinese language. And run [SiliconFriend-ChatGPT/launch.sh](SiliconFriend-ChatGPT/launch.sh) in the repo:

```shell
./SiliconFriend-ChatGPT/launch.sh
```
